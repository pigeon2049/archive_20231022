Viewstamped replication is a replication technique that ensures that operations are applied in the same order on all replicas, even in the event of failures. It introduces a VR proxy for clients to send requests and VR code to handle the protocol and perform business logic. The protocol consists of normal request processing, view change, and recovery. It also includes optimizations such as storing logs on disk, using witness nodes, and batching requests.
